MenuBackend provides an easy way of making menus for the Arduino and is perfect for menus of all kinds from 1 line displays to large LCD graphics panels.

**History:**
MenuBacked was written by Alexander Brevig, and updated by Adrian Brzezinski (v1.4) and Orange Cat (v1.5). The toRoot() method was first suggested by Giuseppe Di Cillo on Coagula ( http://www.coagula.org/content/pages/tutorial-manage-menu-and-lcd-display-arduino ). More information can be found at http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=38053.45 .

The differences between v1.4 and v1.5 can be seen here: https://github.com/Orange-Cat/MenuBackend/commit/551306a894889a07969dacb866662097d0b1c945?w=1

Version v1.6 sets up the left menu item automatically (so that it is much simpler and move obvious to move back). Also storing menu strings in program flash using by using F("string") instead of "string", is supported.
